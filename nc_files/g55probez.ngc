G55	( coordinate system P1 in use )

( Set current Z position in G54 coords to 0 so that we will always be moving down )
G10 L20 P1 Z0.0

( quickly probe down to touch off plate )
G38.2 Z-3.0 F10

( switch to relative coordinates )
G91

( rapid up 0.1 )
G0 Z0.05

( probe slowly to get a more accurate zero )
G38.2 Z-0.2 f0.5

( set G45 Z0.0 to be 0.75 above work surface - this is due to the touchoff plate thickeness )
G10 L20 P1 Z0.75

( switch back to absolute coordinates )
G90

( rapid to Z1.0 - probe tip is now 1" above work surface )
G0 Z1.0
